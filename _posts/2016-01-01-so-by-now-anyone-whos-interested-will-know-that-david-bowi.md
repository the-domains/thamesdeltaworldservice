I’d like to think that it’s not Major Tom in the video as the depiction is literally too simplistic, but then maybe we’re all over analysing it, maybe that is the message of ‘★/Blackstar’, I’m still here, making music, on my own terms, not looking back anymore, no more hits tours.

So by now, anyone who's interested will know that David Bowies new album, '★/Blackstar', will be released on Jan 8th 2016, the day of Bowies 69th birthday. You'll have also seen the video and heard the heard the title track by now. As someone who commented massively on 'The Next Day' and all its contents I feel I'm a little late off the mark this time round. Apologies, I've been away and have had no PC access. However, a little more is known now than the day the single first landed. The artwork for the album is out there, and thanks to subscriber copies of music monthlies the track listing is now known and reviews have been written and read. So I'm not going to rephrase album reviews or anything, just offer my opinion of what we've heard, and help publicise what we know.
