I've been going on about Indigo (previously and in my heart known as Juke) for some time, and their first professionally recorded release is out now, the self-titled EP 'INDIGO'. On digital download or stream, available NOW from iTunes, Amazon, Deezer, Spotify and all major retail digital outlets. A 7" vinyl will be released on the 19th February 2016\.
